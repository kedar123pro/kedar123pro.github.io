Hello, I'm Kedar Potdar, a Sr. System Software Engineer - AI at NVIDIA. With a strong interest in AI Developer Technology, my primary focus lies in creating and enhancing AI products. I am driven by a passion for improving AI product APIs and leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems.

In addition to my role at NVIDIA, I am also a dedicated researcher, having obtained a Master's degree from NYU. My thesis, titled "Edge Computing for Pedestrian Behavior Analytics" delved into the fascinating realm of utilizing edge computing to analyze and understand human behavior.
